# Brainstorming

## Settings
  - Fantasy +3

## Ideas
  - Make the Planets a selection of levels
  - Gropping and Growing plants
  - Inventory 
  - Killing Enemies with the Jetpack
  -

## Taken / Closer Look
  - Gravity / Physics
  - Day (Sunny) / Night (Rain / Wind / Ice) - Timings
    - Enemies at night
    - Spikes because at night the gravity is different

### Open Questions
- Changing colors is allowed?
  - (Max) Asked Wolfen if that would be ok to switch colors on the screen.
  - ‚ÄúIt is up to the interpretation‚Äù üòè

### Puzzle Platformer - Space Theme
  - Platformer
  - Turn world by 90¬∞
  - Turning world changes gravity
  - Gravity usually is view port related downwards 1G
  - Gravity can change from top-down to down-top (pulling down or pulling up)
  - some map elements are dynamic and move when gravity is changed / world turned
  - changing gravity is a power-up
  - turning the world is limited / cool-down / affects score
